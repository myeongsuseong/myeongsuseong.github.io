We are always looking for highly-motivated, strongly-committed new members with different educational levels. Below shows our expectations for prospective members and what you can expect from BSIT. If you are interested in joining BSIT or would like to discuss possible research topics, please contact Dr. Seong via email (myeongsu.seong__at__xjtlu.edu.cn) providing your CV (for undergraduate students: recommended to provide, for graduate students: must be provided), research interest, background (e.g., major, year, research experience, programming ability), and availability as well as your future plan. We will schedule a meeting for discussion.


Undergraduate students
------
We welcome undergraduate students with various STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) backgrounds from XJTLU or other schools. There are various routes you can join us: through SURF (Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship), voluntarily to gain experience and possibly be involved in journal publication, and for working on your bachelor's thesis. As you may see, the projects in BSIT are multi-disciplinary, thus we would be able to discuss and find appropriate research topics for each member. Since you may be a beginner in research activity, you can expect to get various help from Dr. Seong so that you can grow as a junior researcher. No prior research experience is required but your commitment to the assigned project is expected (e.g., more than 8 hours of working time per week). While not required, it would be helpful if you have any experience using C/C++/C#, MATLAB, LabVIEW, and/or Python, in hardware programming (e.g., Arduino, ARM, or FPGA), or artificial intelligence (You may be able to take a look the relevant experience expected for graduate students as well). Depending on your current skill sets and desire, a project will be assigned after discussion and exploration of possible topics with Dr. Seong.  
We will aim for all undergraduate students to be involved in the procedures of journal article publications (including topic generation, data preparation, data analysis, and manuscript preparation) which may be helpful if one is considering to study postgraduate degree(s).  
For communications, while it is expected that all communications will be done in English (mainly for increasing your English ability), Dr. Seong, the group leader, can handle communications in Korean and Chinese as well if needed.


Graduate students
------
To make sure all the graduate students graduate on time, more preparations are expected for graduate students than undergraduate students. As the group leader, Dr. Seong will be committed to guaranteeing that each student will have rich research experiences so that all students will be benefitted from doing the graduate program. You are expected to communicate in English with Dr. Seong so that you can maximize your exposure to English and grasp enough skills in the language.   
If you are a master's student, you can expect that you will get enough help in project generation, journal publications, and thesis preparation. You may be able to consider the master’s degree program as a chance to explore whether you want to stay in academia (i.e., continue studying for Ph.D.) or go to the industry.  
If you are a Ph.D. student, less help in project generation, journal publications, and dissertation preparation than master’s students is expected so that you can grow as an independent researcher. You can think that you will be considered a collaborator rather than a student. Ideally, you should be equipped with the abilities to generate research topics, collect and analyze relevant data, publish research articles using the analyzed data, and present the results in both written and oral forms, when you are graduating.  

It would be best if you have more than three of the relevant experiences listed below.  

1. programming experiences using C/C++/C#, MATLAB, LabVIEW, and/or Python
1. knowledge and hands-on-experiences in fiber optics/optics and/or acoustics
1. knowledge and hands-on-experiences in electronics, microprocessors (e.g., Arduino), and/or mechatronic/robotic systems
1. knowledge and/or experience in signal/image processing
1. experiences in cell animal, and/or human experiments
1. experiences in simulation tools
1. experiences in machine learning (e.g., Scikit-learn or machine learning toolbox in MATLAB) and/or deep learning (e.g., Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and/or Fast.ai)
1. prior research experience (e.g., preparation of a manuscript of a research article or conference proceeding)
