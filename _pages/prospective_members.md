We are always looking for new members with different educational levels. Below shows our expectations for prospective members and answers to some of expected questions from prospective members. If you are interested in joining BSIT, please contact Dr. Seong via email (myeongsu.seong__at__xjtlu.edu.cn).

Undergraduate students
======
We welcome undergraduate students with various STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) backgrounds from XJTLU or other schools. As you may see, since the projects in BSIT is multi-disciplinary, we would be able to discuss and find appropriate research topics for each member. No prior research experience is required but your commitment to the assigned project is expected (e.g., more than 8 hours of working time per week). While not required, it would be helpful if you have any programming experiences.

Ideally, we will aim to involve all the undergraduate student to have expeiences in journal publications.



#Expectation for English Languages
#------
#While it is expected that all the communications will be done in English, Dr. Seong, the group leader, can handle communications in Chinese or Korean as well if needed.


Graduate students
======
To make sure all the graduate students to graduate on time, more preparations are expected for graduate students than undergraduate students. It would be ideal if you have more than three of the relevant experiences listed below.
1. programming experiences using MATLAB, LabVIEW, and/or Python
2. knowledge and hands-on-experiences in fiber-optics/optics and/or acoustics
3. knowledge and hands-on-experiences in electronics, microprocessor (e.g., Arduino), and/or mechatronic/robotic systems
4. experiences in in vitro (e.g., cell culture), animal and/or human experiments
5. experiences in simulation tools
6. experiences in machine learning (e.g., scikit-learn or machine learning toolbox in MATLAB) and/or deep learning (e.g., Keras, tensorflow, pytorch, and/or fast-ai)
7. prior research experience (e.g., preparation of a manuscript of a research article or conference proceeding)

#Expectation for English Languages
#------
#To make sure each graduate student to be equipped with a proper level of English language, it is expected to have all the communications in English.
