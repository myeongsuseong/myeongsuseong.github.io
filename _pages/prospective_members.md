We are always looking for highly-motivated, strongly-committed new members with different educational levels. Below shows our expectations for prospective members and what you can expect from Dr. Seong or BSIT. If you are interested in joining BSIT or would like to discuss possible research topics, please feel free to contact Dr. Seong via email (myeongsu.seong__at__xjtlu.edu.cn) providing your CV, research interest, background (e.g., major, year, research experience, programming ability), and availability as well as your future plan (for undergraduate students: recommended to provide, for prospective or current graduate students: must be provided). We will schedule a meeting for discussion.


Undergraduate students
------
We welcome undergraduate students with various STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) backgrounds from XJTLU or other schools. If you have special driven motivation but do not have a STEM background, as exceptional cases, you can be considered to join after discussion. There are various routes you can join us: through SURF (Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship), voluntarily to gain experience and possibly be involved in journal publication, and for working on your bachelor's thesis. As you may see, the projects in BSIT are multi-disciplinary, thus we would be able to discuss and find appropriate research topics for each member. Since you may be a beginner in research activity, you can expect to get various help from Dr. Seong so that you can grow as a junior researcher. No prior research experience is required but your commitment to the assigned project is expected. Those who plan to transfer to Liverpool will not be considered. While not required, it would be helpful if you have any experience using C/C++/C#, MATLAB, LabVIEW, and/or Python, in hardware programming (e.g., Arduino, ARM, or FPGA), or artificial intelligence (You may be able to take a look the relevant experience expected for graduate students as well). Depending on your current skill sets and desire, a project will be assigned after discussion and exploration of possible topics with Dr. Seong.
We will aim for all undergraduate students to be involved in the procedures of journal article publications (including topic generation, data preparation, data analysis, and manuscript preparation) which may be helpful if one is considering study postgraduate degree(s). Before working on a research project, the student will work on writing a manuscript for a review article so that the student can have early exposure to the whole step of the preparation of a journal manuscript. By doing so, Dr. Seong will help the students have one to two journal articles ideally as the first author.    
For communications, while it is expected that all communications will be done in English (mainly to enhance your English ability), Dr. Seong can handle communications in Korean and Chinese as well if needed.   


Graduate students
------
To make sure all the graduate students graduate on time, more preparations are expected for graduate students than undergraduate students. As the academic advisor, Dr. Seong will be committed to guaranteeing that each student will have rich research experiences so that all students will benefit from doing the graduate program. You are expected to communicate in English with Dr. Seong so that you can maximize your exposure to English and grasp enough skills in the language.   
If you are a master's student, you can expect that you will get enough help in project generation, journal publications, and thesis preparation. You may be able to consider the master’s degree program as a chance to explore whether you want to stay in academia (i.e., continue studying for Ph.D.) or go to the industry. It is recommended to join BSIT as early as possible (ideally in the first semester) so that the student can have an opportunity to work on writing a manuscript for a review article so that the student can have early exposure to the whole step of the preparation of a journal manuscript. We will aim that all the master's students will be able to have one to two journal articles published or submitted as the first author.   
If you are a Ph.D. student, less help in project generation, journal publications, and dissertation preparation than master’s students is expected so that you can grow as an independent researcher. Thus, you are expected to be gradually independent as you are going toward the end of your Ph.D. program. Dr. Seong will do his best to support you so that you can have an idea of what an independent researcher should be and how you should further progress when you are receiving the Ph.D. degree. Ideally, you should be equipped with the abilities to generate research topics, collect and analyze relevant data, publish research articles using the analyzed data, and present the results in both written and oral forms, when you are graduating.  

It would be best if you have more than three of the relevant experiences listed below.  

1. programming experiences using C/C++/C#, MATLAB, LabVIEW, and/or Python
1. knowledge and hands-on-experiences in fiber optics/optics and/or acoustics
1. knowledge and hands-on-experiences in electronics, microprocessors (e.g., Arduino), and/or mechatronic/robotic systems
1. knowledge and/or experience in signal/image processing
1. experiences in cell, animal, and/or human experiments
1. experiences in simulation tools
1. experiences in machine learning (e.g., Scikit-learn or machine learning toolbox in MATLAB) and/or deep learning (e.g., Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and/or Fast.ai)
1. prior research experience (e.g., preparation of a manuscript of a research article or conference proceeding)
