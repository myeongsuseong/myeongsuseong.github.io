Biomedical Signal, Imaging, and Therapeutics Laboratory (BSIT), led by Dr. Myeongsu Seong, is a research laboratory in the Department of Mechatronics and Robotics, School of Advanced Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU). BSIT focuses on the development of hardware and software relevant to biomedical engineering systems that involve the use of optical, ultrasonic, mechatronic, and robotic systems, and applications of the developed systems in preclinical and clinical studies. We are interested in using artificial intelligence techniques for developing new signal processing methods as well.

BSIT welcomes highly-motivated researchers or students with various academic backgrounds. If you are interested in joining the laboratory or want to understand research works in the laboratory, please contact Dr. Seong through email (myeongsu.seong__at__xjtlu.edu.cn). You may be able to check the section of [Prospective members](https://myeongsuseong.github.io/prospective_members/) as well.

In the meantime, BSIT is interested in initiating multi-disciplinary collaborations (either medical or non-medical related), if you think we can do collaborative works or would like to discuss possible collaborative projects, please reach out to Dr. Seong via email (myeongsu.seong__at__xjtlu.edu.cn).
