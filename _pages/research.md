Our short-term goal is to develop systems and algorithms that can be utilized in biomedical applications. Systems that we are mainly interested in may include monitoring systems, stimulation systems, and therapeutic systems. While the group mainly focuses on the development of systems that have the potential to be used in biomedical fields, we are open to performing collaborative works that may be able to lead to breakthroughs in other fields.  Please see below to understand more details about the research directions of BSIT.    

System development
------
Diffuse optical systems 


Algorithm development
------
The ranges of algorithms that we develop spans from simple signal processing methods to artificial-intelligence-based methods.


Simulation studies
------
Simulation is a computational approach used to test the feasibility of experimental schemes.  

Application studies
------
Developed systems are used in preclinical (i.e., animal experiments) and clinical studies.
