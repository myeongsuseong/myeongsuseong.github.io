Our short-term goal is to develop systems and algorithms that can be utilized in biomedical applications. Systems that we are mainly interested in may include monitoring systems, stimulation systems, and therapeutic systems. While the group mainly focuses on the development of technologies that have the potential to be used in biomedical fields, we are open to performing collaborative works that may be able to lead to breakthroughs in other fields. Please see below to understand more details about the research directions of BSIT.    

System development
------
We are interested in building various systems. Benchtop system and portable system
robotic system 


Algorithm development
------
The ranges of algorithms that we develop spans from simple signal processing methods to artificial-intelligence-based methods.


Simulation studies
------
A simulation is a computational approach used to test the feasibility of experimental schemes. While simulation is mostly used as a complementary method to back up the experimental results, aaaa. We use various simulation tools for performing optical (e.g., [Monte Carlo Extreme](https://mcx.space)) and acoustic (e.g., [k-Wave](https://kwave.org)) simulations. We are also interested in multi-physics simulations.

Application studies
------
Developed systems are used in preclinical (i.e., cell and/or animal experiments) and clinical studies.
